A smart IOT+AI integrated boat for waste collection and make the water sources clean.

The invention relates to the field of a portable sustainable mechanism and more specifically to Smart Floating Waste and Algae collecting Boat which detect and collect the floating waste and algae from water bodies and Control by different techniques like Remote sensing and APP. 

The issue of floating waste and algae has emerged as a major environmental problem, posing threats to aquatic ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being. The increasing accumulation of floating waste and algal blooms in water bodies has resulted in adverse ecological consequences and created challenges for sustainable resource management. Understanding the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to address this problem is crucial for effective environmental conservation and the preservation of water quality.

The main aim of the proposed work is to remove the floating trashes and 
algae that are available in the river banks, lakes, ponds, estuaries and urban 
drain. In this proposed system, Smart floating waste and algae collecting 
boat is designed to harvest these floating trashes and algae without any 
manual intervention. The system is integrated with the microcontroller unit 
which is connected with the camera, ultrasonic sensor, GPS module, GSM 
module power supply, relay, infrared and servo motor etc. The camera is 
used to detect the wastes and captures its image with the help of image 
processing. The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the obstacles in order to 
drive the boat properly. When the Power supply is fed to the microcontroller, 
the motor which is coupled with the propeller to operate where the trashes 
are collected by the conveyor and dumped in the bin present inside the boat. 
Once the trashes are filled, the information is sent to the GSM module and 
the boat would return to the hub with the help of GPS and it will remove the 
waste. The information that is received from the GSM module can be sent to 
the mobile phone and its remote. In view of its specific digital components, it 
is more efficient, accurate, precise and reliable in the context of present 
water bodies and its associated ecosystem.
